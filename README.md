# pybitdb-btx

This is an example of how to use BitDB and Bitsocket with Python. It assumes Python3 and provides two simple methods for interfacing with BitDB.

`bitdb.py` -- this is the "library", you can drop this file into your project and use the two utility methods if you wish. `example.py` shows you how to do so.


## setup

```
virtualenv venv --python python3
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## usage

```
python bitdb.py
```

or...


```
python example.py
```
